# react-starter-kit
This is simple react starter kit. It is not create-react-app killer in any way. I just like to have full controll over my dev environment.

## To use:
1. `git clone`
2. `yarn`
3. Change title of your project in `index.html`
4. Change description of your website in `config.json`
5. Replace favicon.ico with your own icon.

## Features included:
1. Babel configuration for React.
2. Airbnb code style. Eslint. Prettier.
3. CSS and SCSS support.
