# react-starter-kit

This is simple react starter kit. It is not create-react-app killer in any way. I just like to have full controll over my dev environment.

2. `git remote remove origin`
3. `yarn`
4. Change title of your project in `index.html` file.
5. Change description of your website in `config.json` file.
6. Replace favicon.ico with your own icon.
7. Change name of your project in `package.json` file.

## Features included:

1. Babel configuration for React.
2. Airbnb code style. Eslint. Prettier.
3. CSS and SCSS support.
